#### Goal

Create something that relates to (a strict subset of) TypeScript like Rhino relates to JavaScript

#### Working

- Some trivial demos ([greeters](https://github.com/stefanhaustein/typo/blob/master/src/main/resources/greeter2.ts) and a [linked list example](https://github.com/stefanhaustein/typo/blob/master/src/main/resources/thindemo.thin) converted from [thinscript](https://github.com/evanw/thinscript))

#### Plan

- Get the raytracer example compiling (with added explicit return types)
- Get the raytracer example running (rendering to VtCanvas)
- Some Cleanup
- WebAssembly output prototype
- Jsdoc output prototype

#### Missing

- Union types and strict nullability
- Dictionaries
- Class member visibility enforcement
- Class visibility enforcement
- Line numbers in later phases
- Const support and enforcement 
- Generics
- Probably a lot more
